# Ancient relic (My first website)
This is my old website that I created a year ago when I first started making TikTok videos. 

This is <ins>based</ins> (not skidded) on [TTB's old website](https://github.com/ttbtech/thetechboy/tree/9a93f0e2ae7b6ed934231659532072899bbdb702). I completely recreated TTB's website's design in Figma ([view design](https://www.figma.com/design/y46zjpp87PrnaRy2Af3nXm/SobakinTech-website?node-id=0-1&t=cLULX2HkBrJMJ1m5-1)) and exported that using [TeleportHQ](https://teleporthq.io/) (I didn't know CSS back then, so I used this method)
